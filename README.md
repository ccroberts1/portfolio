# Dev Portfolio

## Description
This project is to create a professional portfolio that can be used to demonstrate my skills via various projects. The projects listed in the portfolio are all still currently in progress so I do not have active links for them in that section. Once the projects are up and running, I will add those links to the portfolio.
