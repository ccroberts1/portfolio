# Dev Portfolio

## Description

This project was to create a professional portfolio that can be used to demonstrate my skills via various projects. The projects listed in the portfolio are composed of a team project, several smaller web applications and a few applications currently in progress. The two that are still in progress have links to the GitHub repositories but the deployment links are currently inactive. Once these are completed, the deployment links will be fixed.
